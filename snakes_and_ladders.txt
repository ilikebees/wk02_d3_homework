Snakes and Ladders Homework


Questions: 

- What is different from the way you tried to solve the problem?

  -

- Are there any parts you don't understand?

There are lots I don't fully understand at the moment. I plan to go over it more throughly on Thursday night. 


- Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?

I think the dice class has not been tested because how do you test something's returning a random number? It won't give an absolute number. 


- Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?

The viewer class is where all the user interaction is handled. Itâ€™s tidier to keep all of these interactions in one class.
